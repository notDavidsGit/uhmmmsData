# uhmmmsData
data for the not David uhmms video
URL: https://youtu.be/anSjZS63T7s

fill contains the main presentation time-between-uhmmms (in seconds) and the question period time-between-uhmmms (denoted by Q).
Some columns go to different decimal points just because they were taken at different times with different clickers.



The former has 2 header rows:
row 1 is just a numeric identifier. Some individuals were recorded more than once and hence are given #a,#b, etc. Number 10 is my ('not David') data
row 2 is a binary value for whether or not the individual is a `professional'

The question period file has 1 header row - it is the numeric identifier linking it to the first file.
