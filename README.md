# uhmmmsData
data for the not David uhmms video
URL: 

fill contains the main presentation uhmmms and the question period uhmmms (denoted by Q).
Some columns go to different decimal points just because they were taken at different times with different clickers.



The former has 2 header rows:
row 1 is just a numeric identifier. Some individuals were recorded more than once and hence are given #a,#b, etc. Number 10 is my ('not David') data
row 2 is a binary value for whether or not the individual is a `professional'

The question period file has 1 header row - it is the numeric identifier linking it to the first file.
